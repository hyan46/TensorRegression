# Tensor Regression Techniques

We include three methods: 

1. `tensorreg`:  Tensor regression method with known basis for decomposition
2. `tucker_onesetp`: Tucker Decomposition Regression 
3. `onesteptensorreg`: One step tensor regression, currently we use the initialization from `tucker_onestep`, in experimentation, sometimes other initialization should be used for the algorithm to be worked well.
