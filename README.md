# Tensor Regression Techniques

We include three major functions: 

1. `tensorreg`:  Tensor regression method with known basis for decomposition
2. `tucker_onesetp`: Tucker Decomposition Regression, Use Tucker decomposition to learn basis and then perform regression.

Other utility function include: 

- `bsplineBasis`: Create B-spline basis

- `matricize`: matricize tensor along certain dimension. 

- `createSigma`: a method to create covariance matrix, used to create non-i.i.d case.
